## The Problem

Every time you type a name, email, phone number, or credit card into ChatGPT, Claude, Gemini, or any other AI assistant, that data leaves your browser and lands on somebody else's server. It gets logged. It might get used for training. You have no way to get it back.

Most people don't even think about it until it's too late.

## What Veil Does

Veil sits between you and the AI. It watches what you type, spots sensitive information in real time, and gives you a chance to mask it before it ever gets sent. Names become `[PERSON]`. Emails become `[EMAIL REDACTED]`. Credit card numbers never leave your keyboard.

The detection runs entirely on your own machine using a local NLP model called [GLiNER2](https://github.com/fastino-ai/GLiNER2). Nothing is uploaded to a cloud for analysis. Nothing is stored. Nothing is shared.

<br/>

<div align="center">

```
You type:    "Hey, my name is John Smith and my SSN is 123-45-6789"
                                    |
                              Veil intercepts
                                    |
AI receives: "Hey, my name is [PERSON] and my SSN is [SSN REDACTED]"
```

</div>

<br/>

## Key Features

- **Fully local detection** - GLiNER2 ONNX model runs on localhost. Zero cloud calls, zero data egress, works offline after initial setup.
- **Inline highlights** - Grammarly-style underlining shows exactly what Veil found. One click to redact, one click to dismiss.
- **Works everywhere** - ChatGPT, Claude, Gemini, Perplexity, Notion, and any other site with text inputs or contentEditable fields.
- **Regex fallback** - Built-in patterns catch API keys, JWTs, AWS credentials, SSNs, and more. Works instantly even without the local model.
- **Custom patterns** - Add your own regex rules for internal IDs, project codes, or anything specific to your workflow.
- **Adjustable sensitivity** - Low, Medium, or High detection thresholds depending on how aggressive you want the scanning to be.
- **One-command install** - Single curl/PowerShell command sets up the local server, downloads the model, registers autostart, and you're done.
- **Cross-platform** - Linux (systemd), macOS (launchd), and Windows (Task Scheduler) autostart out of the box.

## What It Detects

**Via the GLiNER2 model:** Person names, email addresses, phone numbers, physical addresses, social security numbers, credit card numbers, dates of birth, locations, and organizations.

**Via regex patterns:** OpenAI/AWS/GitHub/Stripe/Twilio API keys, JWTs, IPv4/IPv6 addresses, MAC addresses, Indian PAN/Aadhaar/IFSC numbers, passport numbers, connection strings, private keys, and any custom pattern you define.

---

## Getting Started

### 1. Install the Extension

Download the latest `veil-extension-*.zip` from [Releases](https://github.com/Maya-Data-Privacy/Veil/releases), extract it, then:

1. Open Chrome and go to `chrome://extensions`
2. Turn on **Developer mode** (top right)
3. Click **Load unpacked** and select the extracted folder
4. Note the **Extension ID** shown on the card - you'll need it next

### 2. Install the Local Server

The server handles PII detection using the GLiNER2 model. One command does everything: downloads the server, sets up the Python runtime, downloads the model, registers autostart, and starts the server.

**Linux / macOS:**
```bash
curl -fsSL https://github.com/Maya-Data-Privacy/Veil/releases/latest/download/install.sh \
  | bash -s -- --extension-id YOUR_EXTENSION_ID
```

**Windows** (PowerShell as Administrator):
```powershell
$env:VEIL_EXTENSION_ID='YOUR_EXTENSION_ID'
irm https://github.com/Maya-Data-Privacy/Veil/releases/latest/download/install.ps1 | iex
```

That's it. The server starts immediately and will auto-launch on every login. Open any AI chatbot and start typing - Veil is watching.

### 3. Verify It Works

Click the Veil icon in your browser toolbar. You should see:
- A green status dot indicating the local server is online
- "Local GLiNER2 is online" in the status area

Type something like "My name is John Smith and my email is john@example.com" into any AI chat. Veil should highlight the name and email within a second or two.

## How It Works Under the Hood

```
Browser Tab (chatgpt.com, claude.ai, etc.)
    |
    v
content.js ---- monitors input fields ----> background.js (service worker)
    |                                              |
    |   highlights + redaction UI                  v
    |<-----------------------------    GLiNER2 ONNX server (127.0.0.1:8765)
    |                                  via native_host.py (Chrome native messaging)
    v
User sees inline highlights. One-click redaction replaces PII before submission.
```

1. **content.js** watches every text input and contentEditable field on the page. When you type, it debounces and sends the text to the background service worker.
2. **background.js** forwards the text to the local GLiNER2 server over `localhost:8765` (via Chrome's native messaging bridge for reliability).
3. The **GLiNER2 server** runs the ONNX model, finds entities, and returns detection results with positions and confidence scores.
4. **content.js** renders inline highlights over the detected spans. You can dismiss false positives or accept redactions with a single click.

All of this happens locally. The extension's manifest includes a strict Content Security Policy (`script-src 'self'; object-src 'none'`) and no remote code is ever loaded or executed.

---

## Configuration

### Sensitivity Levels

| Level  | Threshold | When to Use |
|--------|-----------|-------------|
| Low    | 0.75      | Fewer detections, higher precision. Good if you're getting false positives. |
| Medium | 0.62      | Balanced. This is the default. |
| High   | 0.52      | Catches more, but expect some noise. Use when handling highly sensitive data. |

### Custom Regex Patterns

Head to the extension's Settings page, scroll to **Advanced**, and add patterns like:

```json
{
  "id": "internal_employee_id",
  "label": "employee_id",
  "pattern": "\\bEMP-[0-9]{6}\\b",
  "flags": "g",
  "score": 0.99,
  "replacement": "[EMPLOYEE ID]",
  "enabled": true
}
```

### Anonymisation Service (Optional)

Veil can optionally connect to the [Maya Data Privacy](https://mayadataprivacy.in) anonymisation API for smarter replacements - turning `John Smith` into a consistent synthetic alias like `Alex Johnson` instead of a generic `[PERSON]` tag. This is entirely opt-in and requires your own API key. Disabled by default.

---

## Uninstalling

**Linux / macOS:**
```bash
curl -fsSL https://github.com/Maya-Data-Privacy/Veil/releases/latest/download/uninstall.sh | bash
```

**Windows:**
```powershell
irm https://github.com/Maya-Data-Privacy/Veil/releases/latest/download/uninstall.ps1 | iex
```

This removes the server, Python virtual environment, downloaded models, autostart registration, and native messaging host config. The Chrome extension itself is removed separately from `chrome://extensions`.

---

## Development

### Prerequisites

- Node.js 18+
- Python 3.11 (managed automatically by `uv`)
- Chrome or any Chromium-based browser

### Setup

```bash
git clone https://github.com/Maya-Data-Privacy/Veil.git
cd Veil
npm run setup                    # provisions Python 3.11 + dependencies via uv
npm run download-gliner2         # downloads the ONNX model (~2 GB)
npm run run-gliner2              # starts the local server on port 8765
```

Load `extension/` as an unpacked extension in Chrome, and you're developing.

### Running Tests

```bash
npm run test:unit              # JavaScript unit tests
npm run test:unit:python       # Python unit tests (pytest)
npm run test:e2e               # Playwright end-to-end tests (headless Chromium)
npm run test:e2e:headed        # same, but with a visible browser
```

### Version Management

Version is defined once in `package.json`. After editing it, run:

```bash
npm run version:sync           # propagates to manifest.json + pyproject.toml
npm run version:check          # CI uses this to catch drift
```

### Building a Release

```bash
npm run build:zip              # extension zip for Chrome Web Store
npm run build:backend-bundle   # server tarball for GitHub Release
npm run build:model-bundle     # ONNX model tarball for GitHub Release
```

Releases are triggered by pushing a `v*` tag. The CI pipeline verifies version consistency across all files, runs the full test suite, and uploads release assets automatically.

## Security

### What Veil Protects Against

Accidental disclosure of personal data to AI services. If you paste your SSN into ChatGPT without thinking, Veil catches it and gives you a chance to redact it first.

### What It Does Not Protect Against

A compromised browser, a malicious extension with higher privileges, OS-level keyloggers, or network interception. Veil is a privacy guardrail, not a security perimeter.

### Extension Permissions

| Permission | Why |
|---|---|
| `storage` | Saves your settings (sensitivity, custom patterns, enabled state) locally |
| `activeTab` | Shows per-tab detection stats in the popup |
| `scripting` | Fallback content script injection for dynamic iframes |
| `nativeMessaging` | Connects to the local GLiNER2 server via Chrome's native messaging bridge |
| `<all_urls>` | Monitors text inputs on any site where you might type sensitive data |

### Reporting Vulnerabilities

Please do not open public issues for security vulnerabilities. See [docs/SECURITY.md](docs/SECURITY.md) for responsible disclosure instructions.
